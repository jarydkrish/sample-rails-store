# Sample Rails Store

WIP.

Eventually, this is to be a simple demo store that I'm using to test out things like [Facebook's Product API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/dynamic-product-ads/product-catalog), [Open Graph markup](http://ogp.me), [Twitter Card markup](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview), [Google's different structured data markup types](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data).

Other things I would like to test out include setting up [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js?) into a SPA (Single Page App), written using React.
